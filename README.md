J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience (Forage)
🧮 Natural Gas Forecasting & Contract Valuation
📊 J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience (Forage)
This project was completed as part of the J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Internship on Forage. It combines data forecasting, predictive modeling, and financial decision-making through two structured tasks.
📁 Project Overview
This simulation mimics a real-world scenario in the energy commodities market, focusing on natural gas price forecasting and storage contract valuation.
✅ Task 1: Forecasting Natural Gas Prices (2025)
Goal: Predict monthly natural gas prices for 2025 using historical data from 2021 to 2024.

Approach:
Time series decomposition by month
Built 12 linear regression models (1 per month)
Predicted prices for each month in 2025
Combined historical and forecast data
Visualized the trends using matplotlib

Key Tools:
pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

✅ Task 2: Storage Contract Valuation Model
Goal: Simulate profit or loss of storing and selling natural gas under different contract conditions.

Logic Included:
Price lookup using historical + predicted data
Injection and withdrawal price logic
Duration-based storage cost
Operational cost adjustment
Scenario-based profit/loss calculation

Key Parameters:
Injection/Withdrawal Dates
Rate of Injection
Storage Volume Cap
Monthly Storage Cost

🔄 Task Integration
The withdrawal price in Task 2 uses forecasted prices generated in Task 1. This models a real-world dependency between predictive analytics and financial strategy.
